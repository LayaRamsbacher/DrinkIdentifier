## Tasks Implemented by Me

- **Branch `bug_hunt`**:
    - Took care of fixing syntax errors, type issues, and making adjustments to methods.
    - Made improvements to the `StringQueue` class and its methods due to warnings in VSCode. 
    - Example: Changed `element.size() == 0` to `element.isEmpty()` for better clarity and performance.

- **Branch `double_queue`**:
    - Created the `DoubleQueue.java` class and its corresponding `IDoubleQueue` interface.
    - The implementation is similar to `StringQueue.java`, but designed to handle `double` values in the queue.

- **Branch `tests`**:
    - Developed test cases for the previously mentioned classes.
    - Added Javadoc comments to the test classes to ensure proper documentation and readability.

 **Branch `maven_site`**:
    - Created the `maven_site` branch to handle documentation tasks.
