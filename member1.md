## Tasks Implemented by Me

- **Branch `bug_hunt`**:
    - Fixed syntax errors, resolved type issues, and optimized method implementations.
    - Improved the `StringQueue` class and its methods to address warnings in VSCode.
    - Example: Replaced `element.size() == 0` with `element.isEmpty()` to enhance readability and performance.

- **Branch `double_queue`**:
    - Developed the `DoubleQueue.java` class along with the corresponding `IDoubleQueue` interface.
    - The implementation is similar to `StringQueue.java`, but tailored to handle `double` values in the queue.

- **Branch `tests`**:
    - Implemented test cases for the previously developed classes.
    - Added Javadoc comments to the test classes for improved documentation and clarity.
    - Tests were written for the following classes: `StringQueueTest.java`, `DoubleQueueTest.java`, and `LiquidTest.java`.

- **Branch `maven_site`**:
    - Created the `maven_site` branch to manage documentation tasks.
    - Added developer information to pom.xml 

- **Branch `queue_dzinovic`**:
    - Created a new branch named after my last name, where I implemented the `remove()` and `element()` methods in `DrinkQueue.java`.
